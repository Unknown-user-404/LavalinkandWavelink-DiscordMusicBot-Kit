It's best to install the openjdk-16.0.1_windows-x64_bin.zip file and extract it in the same directory as the bot.py file.

Then click into the openjdk.16.0.1 folder.

Click into jdk-16.0.1, then bin.

Then you open up a command prompt in that directory.

Check if there is a file called lavalink.jar, if it is then you are good to go!

After that, just past this command in: java -jar lavalink.jar.

If you didn't found a file called lavalink.jar, go to this link and follow the instruction below: https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink.

Watch the bottom right, see a releases colum? Click on the newest release, sorted on the top.

Then you put the Lavalink.jar in the \openjdk-16.0.1_windows-x64_bin\jdk-16.0.1\bin\ directory.

Then run this command again: java -jar lavalink.jar.

It should work!
